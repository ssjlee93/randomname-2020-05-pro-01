## Upon finishing the pro
* Steve spent majority of his time looking for an API that works for this pro. 
* Some new technologies we've visited: 
1. Greensock.js: animating js library 
2. Materialize: CSS framework. Bootstrap alternative that overlaps with Bootstrap. 
3. Material Design for Bootstrap: CSS framework that works with Bootstrap
4. OAuth type APIs: OAuth requires the user to login to make ajax calls. 
5. Google APIs and Amazon APIs
